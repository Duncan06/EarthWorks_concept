                John and Chris have worked together professionally for over two
                decades. They both have worked together under the professional
                construction company FlatIron for years. In addition to this
                They have taken on jobs as a two man team doing freelance work,
                as well as personal work that would typically run for tens of
                thousands of dollars if professionals were hired.

                There most likely is not an aspect of construction that either
                of them have not touched. Also their amount of hands on
                experience with machinary is second to none. They have both
                worked up and down the east coast for multiple years,
                experienceing a range of different soils, materials, and
                conditions to work with.
